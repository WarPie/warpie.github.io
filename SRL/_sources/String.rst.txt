String related methods


------------
 
 `AnsiString` is used instead of `string`, because 
  code completion doesn't support `string`
  
  Another code completion workaround:


------------

  Copy the string from after the first occurrence of SubStr


------------

  Copy the string from before the first occurrence of SubStr


------------

  Count the number of occurrences of the given string.


------------

  Replace occurrences of the given SubStr with with ReplaceStr
  For larger string this algorithm is way faster than `Replace` in Simba.

  Fix me!!!


------------

  Blow up the string at each delimiter into smaller strings


------------

  test if a string only contains alpha numerical characters.


------------

  test if a sting is a digit


------------

  test if a string is a floating point number


------------

  test if a string only contains letters a-zA-Z


------------

  Extract all the numbers found in the string.
